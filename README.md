# DragnilarsHorrendousRepo
A collection of horrible stuff. Never use it. 

<h1>It's All Horrible</h1>
- Most of the projects contained in this solution/repo are intentionally bad. It is very much so likely that you will not find any of this useful.
<br><br>
- That being said, if you do find any of this stuff useful (I.E. You need to make a joke Windows Forms app), then by all means, feel free to use it.
<br><br>

<h2>What's In Here?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Customer Probably Regrets:  An example of a program that crashes, errors out, sends you to stupid YT videos and more.</u></li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
- Most or all of the stuff in this repo should not require anything special to run or build. <br>
- The only "proprietary" thing that may be in this repo are icons from <a href="http://www.icons8.com">Icons8</a>*.<br>
